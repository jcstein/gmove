"Hey everyone, I'm Josh, Developer Advocate at Celestia Labs. Today we'll dive in and learn how I built this game."

[5 second clip/montage of game]

This game is a demo for the Mammothon, the 2025 Celestia hackathon. The Mammothon is all about encouraging people to build in the Celestia ecosystem and this project focuses on building on Movement.
- Recommend watching video first, tutorial is below
- I designed the repository so that you can pull out my game and replace it with your own.

[longer demo]
- Voiceover: When you come to page, there's leaderboard, login with wallet, do ABC in game, and save your last score. Top 10 scores are stored in leaderboard array.
- All state is stored in a move module on Movement

[what is movement?]
- Movement is a L2 on Ethereum that uses Celestia for data availability (aka everyone being able to verify the data themselves) https://movementlabs.xyz/
- Smart contracts in EVM or Move or _____
- Full disclosure I used Claude to help write the smart contract and the app. Don't be afraid to lean into AI.

[look at repo]
- now let's look at the repository. there's a move directory with the move module in it, and a frontend dir with frontend
contract
- this is how you get a high score
- this is how you your score writes to scoreboard
- show how wallet connection is working
- show where module interactions live in the code
- this is how you deploy it
